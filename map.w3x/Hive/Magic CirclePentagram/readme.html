<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A bit of playing I did with ribbons in Magos Model Editor, came out like something I&#039;d actually use so I&#039;m uploading.<br />
<br />
Rushed the other two versions.<br />
<br />
Currently only has &quot;death&quot; animation available, so you cannot use it as anything other than a sfx (not even a buff/effect).<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, do try not to &quot;move&quot; it... It&#039;s ribbons and will go crazy.<br />
<br />
I will maybe add more different themes, but I will only modify them (add animations etc) if someone actually needs it.</p>
